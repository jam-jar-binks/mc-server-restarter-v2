# mc-server-restarter-v2
put all files into the root directory of your minecraft server. ie. right next to server.jar

make sure you have both run.bat and backup.bat in the same directory

MAKE SURE YOUR SERVER JAR FILE IS CALLED "server.jar"

MAKE SURE THE WORLD FILE IS CALLED "world"

THIS NEEDS TO BE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY AS BOTH THESE FILES
